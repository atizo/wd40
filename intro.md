# Introduction #

This document is like WD-40 for your web application projects. And we are talking [rocket science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WD-40) here! It makes your web development go smooth and slick using this extra knowledge you always looked for.


## Background ##

The authors of this document are a small team of software engineers and an interaction designer, based in Berne, Switzerland. For about six years we've been designing, developing and maintaining the virtual brainstorming platform [Atizo.com](https://www.atizo.com). During this time we've learned a lot about building real world, reliable and state of the art web applications. In an attempt to share these insights with you, we like to provide this document and a sample application.

If you have any feedback or corrections, feel free to open a pull request or issue.


## Prerequisites ##

This collection is intended for programmers already having experience with web applications and understanding core web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3. We assume you work with a Unix-based operating system and know Django, Relational Databases and AngularJS.

We strongly suggest to read [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/), since many of our findings are covered by this methodology.


## Braindump ##

To complete this document, we created a real web application called [Braindump](). You may want to study its [source code]() to see the described concepts applied.

Braindump is a free to use online brainstorming service.
